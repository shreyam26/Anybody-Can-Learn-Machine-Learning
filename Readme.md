#Anybody Can Learn!... Machine Learning (ML)

As the topic says anyone can learn Machine Learning, from your grandma to an expert in Computer Science if explained dedicatedly. This blog is about Machine Learning in a simplified version.

Artificial Intelligence(AI), the most heard term of today's time and its applications quite alot nowadays like Siri/Alexa, self driving cars , face recognition in smart phones/airports and many more.These technologies are yet to be more widely avaialable in future due to availability of Cloud computing and Big data explosion.
AI is a vast field which has Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning (DL) as their subsets to provide more advance techniques.Machine Learning is similar to AI and is implemented by the computers/machines which has ability to learn without being coded explicitly. Deep Learning (DL) on the other hand has the ability to automatically learn / extract / translate the features from a data set without the codes. The data set could be anything maybe a text or video.

A deeper dive to Machine Learning
The ML is categorised into Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement Learning.

Supervised learning as the name suggests has a supervisor who is more knowledgeable than the machine. The data sets that are input to the machine/computer has tagged output ,i.e. the output is already known by the supervisor and is fed to the machine for learning the characteristics and distuiguish between different patterns of output for the particular data set.For example: a Supervised Learning machine can learn which mails are spam and not spam.This will be implemented by feeding the machine with zillions of mails already tagged with 'spam' or 'not spam' for the machine/computer to learn.'Regression', i.e. there are existing data sets and outputs which helps the machine in predicting outcomes on certain fitting functioms and 'Classification',i.e. a certain observation is categorised into certain groups ; are the two methods under Supervised Learning.

Unsupervised learning is implemented to study a particular pattern of the data set which is not known . The machine has to learn the pattern by itself. The Unsupervised learning is carried out using Clustering or dividing the set of elements into two sets based on existing data set.Example:Given some books or news articles and the machine has the classify them under different themes.Another procedure for Unsupervised learning is the Association which is used for market basket analysis and retailers shopping data. Example: People who buy X product are also the ones who tends to buy product Y and so are associated to each other.

Reinforcement Learning: In this category the machines are trained to learn by trial and error methods or you can say machines are trained by recieving 'rewards' or'punishments'.The machine then finds best ways to earn maximum rewards which can be money, winning the game, etc. Example: The AlphaGo game which learns from 30 million moves played in human-in-human games.

What is Deep Learning?

The Deep learning is similar to ML where the machine learns , but from multi-layered artificial networks with many hidden layers stacked one after the other.It resembles human nervous system which contains billions of neurons which recieves signals and passes message to other neurons.The Deep Learning is modelled using Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) which has five layers.
The Input node is associated with input of numerical values. Example: pixel of image.
The Connections are associated with the input nodes and are represented as weights (w) which are any real numbers.
All the values of input along with the weights are brought together as weighted sum.
This weighted sum will be input only when the threshold set by us is exceeded. The output node will then contain result of the function of weighted sum of the input nodes.
The Depth of Deep Learning is bascially the hidden layer neural network.

The three popular DL models are:

Convolution Neural Network are mostly used for image/ video processing or computer visual applications. They are deep artificial networks that cluster images based on their similarity and perform object recognization within scenes. They identify faces and different objects. The most popular ones being the OCR to digitalize text to automate data entry.
To perform Deep Learning using CNN , a series of images are passed through series of convolution layers with filters. These filters are trained using a large training data set with thousands of images with predefined labels.The model first predicts the output label and compares it with the label of the image in the training data set. A loss function is calculated according to the success of prediction. The way the machine is able to decrease its inaccuracies is through Back propagation and determing the weights that lead to the most loss( inaccuracies) . It then finds ways to fine tune these weights to decrease the loss through consecutive passes.
At the end , the network is trained well so that wieghts of the layers are tuned correctly. Next, testing is done to see whether the CNN model works .Examples: Facebook automatic tagging, pinterset photo search, etc.

Recursive Neural Networks uses previous input sources so as to analyze n input or u can say that they have memory that captures information of the previous calculations . they can remember former inputs and so they are used in tasks such as speech recognition.They are alos used for language translations, composing musics, writing novels etc.

Generative Adversarial Networks can Create rather than just getting trained with data sets. A GAN has two neural networks- Generative network and Discriminative network. GANs can be used to reconstruct a estroyed image of old times by increasing the resolution. It can convert text to image , etc.

Deep learning for Natural Language Processing:
Alexa, Siri, Cortona are famous digital personas using Natural Language Processing. It is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human speech.

Happy Learning !
